This template is being implemented by Unimaze Software with feedback from the FUT Technical Committee of Icelandic Standards, which 
is a member of the European standards organizations CEN, CENELEC and ETSI as well as the international standards organizations ISO and IEC.

Common language files were derived and adapted from the work of SFTI in Sweden and OIOUBL in Denmark.
